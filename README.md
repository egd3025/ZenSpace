# About
### Project Overview
Our project aims to develop a VR wellness app designed to provide therapeutic experiences for individuals seeking mental health support. By immersing users in calming virtual environments and guided exercises, this app offers a new way to manage stress, anxiety, and emotional well-being.
### Key Objectives for this Project:
- Conduct user research to find out what information is needed to support the use and practice of VR therapy
- Design a webpage/mobile app responsive, engaging user interface with cohesive branding that aligns with WCAG guidelines
- Develop and publish the mobile app/website
- Create a compelling slide deck to present to stakeholders
